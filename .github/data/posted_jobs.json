      "job_description": "Ready to be pushed beyond what you think you’re capable of?\n\nAt Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom in the world. It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.\n\nTo achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.\n\nOur work culture is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.\n\nWhile many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.\n\nJoin the Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) Money Movement team and help build the infrastructure powering the future of global finance.\n\nCDP brings together payments, trading, wallets, and stablecoins through a single onboarding flow and self-service APIs. Our mission is to make it easy for businesses to embed crypto-native financial capabilities into their products — securely, reliably, and at global scale.\n\nOn the Money Movement team, we’re building the core infrastructure for stablecoin-based payments, enabling fast, secure, and scalable transfers across borders and platforms. This work underpins how value moves across the Coinbase ecosystem and beyond.\n\nWhat you’ll be doing:\n• Design, build, and maintain backend systems and infrastructure that power stablecoin pay-ins, payouts, deposits, and withdrawals.\n• Serve as the Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) for key projects, driving them from design to production with high accountability.\n• Collaborate with cross-functional teams—including product, design, infrastructure, and compliance—to deliver robust and scalable solutions.\n• Work closely with teams across Coinbase (e.g., CDP Payments API, Onramp APIs, CoinBiz) to integrate stablecoin functionality into core products.\n• Help build internal and external APIs that make it easy for businesses and partners to leverage stablecoin-powered money movement.\n• Identify and address performance, scalability, and reliability challenges across systems.\n• Mentor junior engineers and contribute to building a strong, inclusive, and high-performing engineering culture.\n• Stay up to date on the evolving crypto ecosystem, identifying opportunities to improve utility, adoption, and innovation in stablecoin infrastructure.\n\nWhat we look for in you:\n• Minimum 5 years of experience in software engineering.\n• Proven experience building and operating large-scale backend systems, ideally in fintech, payments, or crypto.\n• Strong proficiency in backend technologies (e.g., Go, Java, or similar) and cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, GCP).\n• Deep understanding of distributed systems, APIs, and system design.\n• Experience working with crypto or blockchain technologies is a strong plus—but not required.\n• A product-minded approach to engineering—you care about the “why” behind what you build.\n• Strong ownership mindset with the ability to drive projects end-to-end as a DRI.\n• Collaborative spirit and ability to work cross-functionally with product, design, and engineering teams.\n• Enthusiasm for building foundational technology in a fast-moving, high-impact space.\n\nWhy This Role Matters\n\nStablecoins are becoming a core primitive for global payments. In this role, you’ll help define how businesses of all sizes move money instantly and securely — shaping real-world financial infrastructure at massive scale.\n\nNice to haves:\n• Prior experience working with stablecoins, DeFi protocols, or on-chain payments.\n• Familiarity with smart contract platforms (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Base) and related developer tools.\n• Contributions to open-source crypto or blockchain projects.\n• Experience building multi-chain or cross-chain applications.\n• Knowledge of regulatory or compliance considerations in crypto payments.\n• Interest in or experience with tokenomics, financial primitives, or digital asset infrastructure.\n• Previous experience in a startup or hyper-growth environment where you had to wear multiple hat\n\nJob #: P70177\n\nPay Transparency Notice: Depending on your work location, the target annual *base *salary for this position can range as detailed below. Full time offers from Coinbase also include bonus eligibility + equity eligibility + benefits (including medical, dental, vision and 401(k)).\n\nBase salary range shown. Total compensation also includes equity and bonus eligibility and benefits:\n\n$186,065—$218,900 USD\n\nPlease be advised that each candidate may submit a maximum of four applications within any 30-day period.
