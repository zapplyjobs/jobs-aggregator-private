Throughout their time in the program, MAGNet interns apply their predictive modeling and analytical skills to a variety of data science problems to augment their theoretical coursework while also developing professionally.\n\nIt is not feasible to expose interns to the full variety of topics they need to be familiar with for full-time data science work in a single semester. As such, the MAGNet internship is designed to last the duration of an intern's graduate studies with renewal on a semester-by-semester basis. This means that while this position is hiring for the Summer 2026 semester, the intern may be invited to return for following semester(s), based on the intern's growth and progress relative to the internship's expectations. To continue in the MAGNet program, it is expected that an intern will continue to renew their internship throughout their graduate program for the Spring, Summer, and Fall semesters as applicable. If you are looking for a summer or other short-term internship, MAGNet is not the right fit for you, but you may be interested in State Farm's summer internship programs.\n\nGraduate students at the University of Georgia in highly quantitative disciplines are considered, with an emphasis on understanding of statistical techniques.

These moments are critical to how customers first experience SiriusXM—and to how our business grows.\nYou’ll collaborate with product managers, designers, analysts, engineers, and business partners to create simple, intuitive, and effective conversion experiences used by millions of customers. During the internship, you’ll take ownership of a feature, experiment, or process improvement from discovery through launch and measurement, gaining hands-on exposure to how modern digital products are built and optimized.\n\nWhat you’ll do:\n• Collaborate and communicate cross-functionally with designers, engineers, analysts, researchers, marketers, and operations partners to bring ideas from concept to production.\n• Own a feature, experiment, or process improvement end-to-end — from user research and problem definition to requirements, delivery, and post-launch measurement.\n• Improve customer activation and purchase experiences by responding to qualitative insights, funnel data, and performance metrics across trial and subscription flows.\n• Use data to drive decisions — analyze conversion metrics, identify opportunities, tell a clear story, and help prioritize work based on impact.\n• Contribute new ideas and perspectives, challenging assumptions and asking thoughtful questions about how we can better serve customers.\n• Document trade-offs and recommendations, synthesizing inputs from multiple stakeholders into clear action plans.\n• Run productive meetings and create clear documentation (PRDs, experiment briefs, readouts) that enable alignment and execution.\n• Present your work to a broader product leadership audience and incorporate feedback from experienced product managers.\n\nWhat you’ll need:\n• Internships are open to current students enrolled at a university (those graduating by May 2027 are preferred) and recent graduates who graduated within the 12-month period prior to the start of the internship.\n• Strong communication skills to effectively work with stakeholders, anticipate questions, and articulate decisions with supporting rationale.\n• Previous internship, work, or school experience in consumer-facing digital products, technology, or e-commerce preferred.\n• Comfort working with data to identify problems and answer questions\n• Interaction/graphic design experience or user research experience is a plus.\n• A passion for music and the ambition to create compelling and unique experiences that listeners and customers love.\n• Must have legal right to work in the U.S.\n\nAt SiriusXM, we carefully consider a wide range of factors when determining compensation, including your background and experience. These considerations can cause your compensation to vary. We expect the base salary for this position to be $37-40/hr and will depend on your skills, qualifications, and experience.
