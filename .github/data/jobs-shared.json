Our unique approach to awarding equity grants allows our employees to be shareholders so they can benefit financially in the company's growth.\n\nNon-Competes\n\nVeeva has taken a strong stance against the use of non-compete agreements that can limit employee opportunities. We do not require our employees to sign non-compete agreements, and we have taken legal action to fight the unfair use of these agreements by other companies because we believe such agreements limit an employee's fundamental right to work where they choose.
