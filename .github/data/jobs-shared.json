This project asks how machine learning models can extract generalizable structure from novel, systematically perturbed experimental datasets and apply it to guide exploration of unseen molecular space.\n\nIn this role, you will design and train models that learn the latent “grammar” governing molecular function for our system of interest. Working with a large, novel experimental dataset, you will develop architectures that integrate sequence-level information with geometric and contextual representations. The focus is not merely on improving predictive accuracy, but on uncovering the inductive biases and representational strategies that enable extrapolation—when and why models succeed in new regimes, and when they fail.\n\nYou will explore representation learning approaches for molecular design, investigate tradeoffs between foundation-scale models and structured task-specific models, and develop insights that inform both model construction and experimental strategy. There is also an opportunity for experimental validation of model-derived hypotheses, grounding model behavior in measurable biological outcomes.\n\nThis internship is intended for students who are excited to build models that reveal structure underpinning biology — and who are motivated by contributing work that advances the interface between machine learning and experimental biology.\n\nProgram Highlights\n• Intensive 12-weeks full-time (40 hours per week) paid internship.\n• Program start dates are in May/June 2026.\n• A stipend, based on location, will be provided to help alleviate costs associated with the internship.\n• Ownership of challenging and impactful business-critical projects.\n• Work with some of the most talented people in the biotechnology industry.\n\nWho You Are\n\nRequired Education:\n• Must be pursuing a PhD (enrolled student).\n\nRequired Majors: Computer Science, Biomedical Engineering/Bioengineering, Chemical Engineering, Biomedical Informatics, Computational Biology, Applied Physics, and related technical fields.\n\nRequired Skills:\n• Strong foundation in machine learning or a related quantitative field, with experience training and evaluating models on real, noisy datasets.\n• Excellent programming skills in Python and common deep learning frameworks (e.g. PyTorch, TensorFlow, or equivalent).\n• Experience working with structured or high-dimensional data (e.g., sequences, graphs, or other relational representations).\n• Experience conducting rigorous analysis and interpreting model behavior, including ability to reason about model generalization and extrapolation and diagnosing model limitations and failure modes.\n• Ability to work independently in a fast-paced research environment and clearly communicate technical results in writing and presentations; strong motivation, intellectual curiosity, and eagerness to learn through feedback and iteration.\n\nPreferred Knowledge, Skills, and Qualifications\n• Excellent communication, collaboration, and interpersonal skills.\n• Complements our culture and the standards that guide our daily behavior & decisions: Integrity, Courage, and Passion.\n• Experience with representation learning, including learning latent or compositional features from structured data.\n• Experience with sequence- and/or structure-based modeling (e.g., CNNs, transformers, protein language models).\n• Familiarity with combinatorial or design-oriented modeling problems, where generalization beyond observed data is critical.\n• Interest in or experience with molecular or biological data, such as protein sequences or molecular structures.\n• Prior research experience in machine learning, computational biology, or a related quantitative field.\n• Track record publishing in ML/Comp Bio conferences (ICLR/ICML/NeurIPS/MLCB, etc).\n• Interest in connecting modeling insights to experimentally testable hypotheses.\n\nRelocation benefits are not available for this job posting.\n\nThe expected salary range for this position based on the primary location of California is $50.00 hourly.

Do you want a workplace that will challenge you and offer you opportunities to learn and grow? A position at Xcel Energy could be just what you’re looking for.\n\nAt Xcel Energy, our employees are the driving force behind our success. So we make sure that, here, you can be your best. Doing work that makes a difference for neighbors and communities. Working with a team you can count on to push you. Expanding skills, staying ready for change, and capturing opportunities to grow. All with the support, rewards and recognition you need to thrive – during your internship and beyond.\n\nProject Description\n\nArtificial Intelligence is transforming how work gets done—and Xcel Energy is focused on making sure that transformation delivers real, measurable business value.\n\nWe’re looking for an AI Enablement Intern to join a high‑impact team working at the intersection of AI technology, business problem‑solving, and organizational change. This is a cutting‑edge role for someone excited by AI who wants to help shape how it is applied across a large enterprise—not as experimentation, but as a practical driver of productivity and better ways of working.\n\nIn this role, you’ll operate much like a business‑facing AI solution architect. You’ll partner with teams across the company to understand how their work actually gets done, identify broken or inefficient processes, and help determine where AI—such as Microsoft Copilot or AI agents—can meaningfully improve outcomes. From there, you’ll help turn those ideas into reality by supporting the thoughtful implementation, adoption, and scaling of AI‑enabled solutions.\n\nAt the same time, you’ll contribute to the middle‑out engine that makes AI adoption stick: building community, learning from real wins, and spreading what works so teams can learn from one another. Technology alone doesn’t transform organizations—the combination of the right solutions and the right enablement does. That’s the work this team leads.\n\nThis position is for a June 1, 2026 start. The role may have the possibility to extend beyond the internship based on performance and business needs.\n\nWhat You’ll Work On\n\nThis role intentionally blends two dimensions of our AI Enablement strategy:\n\nTop‑Down: AI Solutioning & Business Value\n• Partner with business teams in a consultative manner to understand workflows, pain points, and opportunities for improvement.\n• Help identify where AI is appropriate—and where it isn’t—by mapping real business problems to practical AI solutions.\n• Contribute to the design of AI‑enabled solutions that improve broken or inefficient processes, with a strong focus on value over novelty.\n• Support implementation efforts, recognizing that successful AI adoption requires more than technology—it requires clear communication, change management, and smart rollout approaches.\n• Help assess and communicate impact, including how AI solutions are improving productivity, quality, or the employee experience.\n\nMiddle‑Out: Community, Learning & Scale\n• Contribute to building the AI community at Xcel Energy by supporting initiatives like the Copilot Flight Plan, Copilot Champions, and Hero Stories that highlight real success.\n• Help capture and share wins, lessons learned, and best practices so effective AI usage spreads across teams.\n• Support engagement strategies that inspire curiosity, confidence, and responsible use of AI tools.\n• Enable teams to learn from one another by helping package insights, stories, and examples in ways that are easy to reuse and adapt.\n\nYou’ll work as part of the AI Enablement team, collaborating internally while also engaging directly with business partners across the organization.\n\nMinimum Requirements\n• Currently enrolled in a bachelor’s or master’s program (as of Fall 2026) in a relevant field (e.g., Business, Information Systems, Engineering, Analytics, Communications, Organizational Development, or similar).\n• Strong curiosity about AI and how it can reshape work—not just from a technology perspective, but from a business and human perspective.\n• Ability to engage with stakeholders, ask good questions, and translate ambiguous problems into clear next steps.\n• Strong written and verbal communication skills; comfortable explaining ideas to both technical and non‑technical audiences.\n• Comfort operating in ambiguity and learning quickly in a fast‑evolving space.\n• Must be a local resident in CO or MN.\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n• Experience working on cross‑functional projects involving technology, process improvement, consulting, or product strategy.\n• Familiarity with modern AI tools (e.g., Microsoft Copilot, automation tools, analytics platforms), or strong interest in learning them quickly.\n• Experience with storytelling, presentations, or content creation that helps spread ideas and best practices.\n• Exposure to change management, adoption strategies, or community‑building efforts.\n• Basic data literacy—comfortable interpreting simple trends or signals to support decision‑making.\n\nVisa sponsorship is not offered for this position.\n\nAs a leading combination electricity and natural gas energy company, Xcel Energy offers a comprehensive portfolio of energy-related products and services to 3.4 million electricity and 1.9 million natural gas customers across eight Western and Midwestern states. At Xcel Energy, we strive to be the preferred and trusted provider of the energy our customers need. If you’re ready to be a part of something big, we invite you to join our team.\n\nAll qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to age, race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran.\n\nIndividuals with a disability who need an accommodation to apply please contact us at recruiting@xcelenergy.com.\n\nNon-Bargaining\n\nThe anticipated starting base pay for this position is: $20.40 to $27.20 per hour\n\nThis position is eligible for the following benefits: Pension, 401(k) plan, Paid time off (PTO), Holidays\n\nBenefit plans are subject to change and Xcel Energy has the right to end, suspend, or amend any of its plans, at any time, in whole or in part.\n\nIn any materials you submit, you may redact or remove age-identifying information including but not limited to dates of school attendance and graduation.

Come be a part of what’s next.\n\nIt’s no secret that we want to entertain the world. In order to do that we first must hire and develop the best people, starting with university students.\n\nIf you have a passion for solving challenging problems and learning how to build active and static protection to manage risk to talent and content creators, then we want to talk to you.\n\nThe Content Operations & Innovation organization at Netflix supports content to thrill members with efficient operational workflows and execution while leveraging our scale and innovating to deliver more value on screen.

Netflix is a unique place to work and we live by our values, so it's worth learning more about our culture.\n\nInternships are paid and are a minimum of 12 weeks, with a choice of a couple fixed start dates in June to accommodate varying school calendars. Conditions permitting, our summer internships in 2024 for Content will be located in our Los Angeles, CA, office.\n\nAt Netflix, we carefully consider a wide range of compensation factors to determine the Intern top of market. We rely on market indicators to determine compensation and consider your specific internship team, degree, and years of education to get it right.
