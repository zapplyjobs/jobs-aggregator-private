Our nurses are valuable team members and help develop a culture of inclusion and respect. UMC is a teaching institution, so we value learning and development, giving you ample opportunity to expand your skills and knowledge with continued education. Our unit is fast-paced and you’ll find great people working together with other professional interdisciplinary teams.\n\nMedical ICU : Offers the opportunity to explore a wide array of pathophysiology.

The physician leadership team consists of critical care boarded anesthesiologists who are champions for the nursing staff. The nurse-to-patient ratio is optimally 2 patients per 1 nurse. This can be adjusted by the charge nurse according to patient and staffing needs.
