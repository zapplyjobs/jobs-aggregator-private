We make it easier to get answers, access high-quality care quickly, and feel supported throughout treatment and beyond.\n\nToday, Thyme Care is a market-leading value-based oncology care enabler, partnering with national and regional health plans, providers, and employers to deliver better outcomes and lower costs for thousands of people across the country. Our model combines high-touch human support with powerful technology and AI to bring together everyone involved in a person’s cancer journey: caregivers, oncologists, health plans, and employers.\n\nAs a tech-native organization, we believe technology should strengthen the human connection at the center of care. Through data science, automation, and AI, we simplify complexity, improve collaboration, and help care teams focus on what matters most: supporting people through cancer.\n\nLooking ahead, our vision is bold: to become a household name in cancer care, where every person diagnosed asks for Thyme Care by name. If you’re inspired to make cancer care more human and to help reimagine what’s possible, we’d love to meet you. Together, we can build a future where every person with cancer feels truly cared for, in every moment that matters.\n\nWHAT YOU’LL DO\n\nAt Thyme Care, we believe that our success as an organization lies in our ability to attract and retain the most talented, capable, empathetic, and kind talent who care deeply about helping people throughout their cancer journey. The Recruiting team is the engine that drives our internal growth.\n• After ramping up, you will hire a high monthly volume of nurses and other clinical talent as needed by Thyme Care. This will primarily be driven by applicants, referrals, job posts, and sourcing.\n• Optimize the recruiting strategy for clinical and frontline hires that align with health plan contracts.\n• Collaborate closely with the existing recruiting team and internal stakeholders to achieve hiring objectives and adapt to fluctuations in hiring needs.\n• Enhance and establish end-to-end recruitment processes as necessary.\n• Quickly familiarize yourself with the oncology field and Value-Based Care to become a trusted business partner to our executive team.\n• Provide expert guidance to hiring managers in role definition and candidate selection.\n• Flexibility to support recruitment efforts for other positions throughout the organization.\n\nWe’d expect you to dive into full-cycle recruiting capacities quickly as you get up to speed on Thyme Care, oncology, the tech-enabled value-based care landscape, and US healthcare.\n\nWHAT YOU’VE DONE\n• A minimum of 5 years of experience, with at least 2 years in clinical recruiting.\n• Experience supporting high-growth or startup organizations\n• Demonstrated ownership of end-to-end, high-volume recruiting processes, with the ability to develop and execute strategies to meet hiring plans\n• Metrics-driven approach, leveraging data to efficiently manage and scale the hiring process\n• Proven ability to manage multiple requisitions simultaneously while maintaining quality and pace\n• Track record of personal and professional growth, with a strong desire to continue learning and advancing\n• Prior experience with Greenhouse is highly desired, including accurate tracking of recruiting activity and maintenance of thorough, compliant documentation\n\nWHAT LEADS TO SUCCESS\n• Patient-first. Thyme Care’s mission and members matter to you, deeply.\n• A bias to action. You like to get things done. You don’t need anyone to tell you when to do your work. Scope doesn’t matter, you’ll always find ways to contribute even if it’s “not your job.” In the same vein, no job is too small for you.\n• Effective listener and communicator. You are persuasive and articulate but always start by listening. You build rapport, trust, and great working relationships with colleagues.\n• Expertise. You’ll excel in this role if you have had at least 5 years of experience in a recruiting role, love building efficient processes, fostering strong relationships, setting expectations, and getting things done. It’s important that you are process-oriented and willing to learn new tools and technology. You’ll work with Greenhouse and Google Suite every day.\n• People-focused. You are passionate about people and enjoy creating excellent partnerships with peers and executives across the team and ecosystem.\n• Comfort with ambiguity. You have a proven track record of success within scaling businesses, fast-paced environments, and startups. You understand that rapid changes to the business, strategy, organization, and priorities is par for the course.\n\nOUR VALUES\n\nAt Thyme Care, our core values guide us in everything we do: Act with our members in mind, Move with purpose, and Seek diverse perspectives. They anchor our business decisions, including how we grow, the products we make, and the paths we choose—or don’t choose.\n\nThe contract rate for this role is $70 per hour, 40 hours per week. The contract rate could be lower or higher than this if the role is hired in another location or at another level.\n\nThe hourly range could be lower or higher than this if the role is hired in another location or at another level.\n\nWe recognize a history of inequality in healthcare. We’re here to challenge the status quo and create a culture of inclusion through the care we give and the company we build. We embrace and celebrate a diversity of perspectives in reflection of our members and the members we serve. We are an equal-opportunity employer.\n\nBe cautious of recruitment fraud, and always confirm that communications are coming from an official Thyme Care email.","enriched":false,"enriched_at":null,"is_internship":false,"is_new_grad":false,"is_remote":true,"is_us_only":true,"_raw":{"job_id":"C81rGjrg04if_995AAAAAA==","job_publisher":"DailyRemote","job_latitude":null,"job_longitude":null},"tags":{"employment":"senior","domains":["general"],"locations":["remote","us"],"experience":"under_3_years","special":[]}}

(NYSE: RSG) is a leader in the environmental services industry. We provide customers with the most complete set of products and services, including recycling, waste, special waste, hazardous waste and field services. Our industry-leading commitments to advance circularity and support decarbonization are helping deliver on our vision to partner with customers to create a more sustainable world.\n\nIn 2023, Republic’s total company revenue was $14.9 billion, and adjusted EBITDA was $4.4 billion. We serve 13 million customers and operate more than 1,000 locations, including collection and transfer stations, recycling and polymer centers, treatment facilities, and landfills.\n\nAlthough we operate across North America, the collection, recycling, treatment, or disposal of materials is a local business, and the dynamics and opportunities differ in each market we serve. By combining local operational management with standardized business practices, we drive greater operating efficiencies across the company while maintaining day-to-day operational decisions at the local level, closest to the customer.\n\nOur customers, including small businesses, major corporations and municipalities, want a partner with the expertise and capabilities to effectively manage their multiple recycling and waste streams. They choose Republic Services because we are committed to exceeding their expectations and helping them achieve their sustainability goals. Our 41,000 team members understand that it's not just what we do that matters, but how we do it.\n\nOur company values guide our daily actions:\n• Safe: We protect the livelihoods of our colleagues and communities.\n• Committed to Serve: We go above and beyond to exceed our customers’ expectations.\n• Environmentally Responsible: We take action to improve our environment.\n• Driven: We deliver results in the right way.\n• Human-Centered: We respect the dignity and unique potential of every person.\n\nWe are proud of our high employee engagement score of 86. We have an inclusive and diverse culture where every voice counts. In addition, our team positively impacted 4.6 million people in 2023 through the Republic Services Charitable Foundation and local community grants. These projects are designed to meet the specific needs of the communities we serve, with a focus on building sustainable neighborhoods.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nRepublic Services’ strategy is designed to generate profitable growth. Through acquisitions and industry advancements, we safely and sustainably manage our customers’ multiple waste streams through a North American footprint of vertically integrated assets.\n\nWe focus on three areas of growth to meet the increasing needs of our customers: recycling and waste, environmental solutions and sustainability innovation.\n\nWith our integrated approach, strengthening our position in one area advances other areas of our business. For example, as we grow volume in recycling and waste, we collect additional material to bolster our circularity capabilities. And as we expand environmental solutions, we drive additional opportunities to provide these services to our existing recycling and waste customers.\n\nRecycling and Waste\n\nWe continue to expand our recycling and waste business footprint throughout North America through organic growth and targeted acquisitions. The 13 million customers we serve and our more than 5 million pick-ups per day provide us with a distinct advantage. We aggregate materials at scale, unlocking new opportunities for advanced recycling. In addition, we are cross-selling new products and services to better meet our customers’ specific needs.\n\nEnvironmental Solutions\n\nOur comprehensive environmental solutions capabilities help customers safely manage their most technical waste streams. We are expanding both our capabilities and our geographic footprint. We see strong growth opportunities for our offerings, including PFAS remediation, an increasing customer need.\n\nSUSTAINABILITY INNOVATION\n\nRepublic’s recent innovations to advance circularity and decarbonization demonstrate our unique ability to leverage sustainability as a platform for growth.\n\nThe Republic Services Polymer Center is the nation’s first integrated plastics recycling facility. This innovative site processes rigid plastics from our recycling centers, producing recycled materials that promote true bottle-to-bottle circularity. We also formed Blue Polymers, a joint venture with Ravago, to develop facilities that will further process plastic material from our Polymer Centers to help meet the growing demand for sustainable packaging. We are building a network of Polymer Centers and Blue Polymer facilities across North America.\n\nWe continue to advance decarbonization at our landfills. As demand for renewable energy continues to grow, we have 70 landfill gas-to-energy projects in operation and plan to expand our portfolio to 115 projects by 2028.\n\nRECENT RECOGNITION\n• Barron’s 100 Most Sustainable Companies\n• CDP Discloser\n• Dow Jones Sustainability Indices\n• Ethisphere’s World’s Most Ethical Companies\n• Fortune World’s Most Admired Companies\n• Great Place to Work\n• Sustainability Yearbook S&P Global","enriched":false,"enriched_at":null,"is_internship":false,"is_new_grad":false,"is_remote":true,"is_us_only":true,"_raw":{"job_id":"Gp7IKJ3-gvuVstaVAAAAAA==","job_publisher":"DailyRemote","job_latitude":null,"job_longitude":null},"tags":{"employment":"entry_level","domains":["general"],"locations":["remote","us"],"experience":"3_plus_years","special":[]}}
