Here, you'll collaborate with passionate teams, tackle real-world challenges, and see your impact in how customers transform and grow. If you're ready to bring curiosity, creativity, and drive to every moment, NetApp is where your journey begins.\n\nJob Summary\n\nAt NetApp, we help customers turn operational complexity into opportunity through intelligent data infrastructure. Our success depends on the reliability and predictability of our cloud services, and that begins with disciplined release management, strong change governance, and seamless coordination across engineering teams.\n\nWe are seeking an Deployment Manager to support release execution activities across a cloud storage service. In this role, you will contribute to safe and timely production deployments by ensuring that release processes and change management workflows are executed with high quality and attention to detail.\n\nYou will work closely across Engineering teams and cross‑functional partners to keep releases moving efficiently, ensure compliance with change management requirements, and provide operational visibility to leadership. Based on experiences with driving software deployment, you will generate a roadmap to automate and optimize processes making software deployment more robust and efficient. The roadmap will include building a framework for engineering teams to conduct their own software deployment autonmously, ensuring adequate service health validation checks are in place and reporting is available for passive use. This is an excellent role for someone early in their career who is detail‑oriented, process‑driven, and passionate about reliability, quality, and operational excellence.\n\nSuccess Profile\n\nA successful Deployment Manager typically demonstrates the following traits:\n• Detail‑oriented and methodical\n• Organized with strong task‑tracking habits\n• Clear communicator across async and real‑time channels\n• Comfortable with fast‑paced, multi‑stakeholder environments\n• Process‑minded with interest in operational rigor\n• Eager to learn, ask questions, and grow domain expertise\n• Collaborative, supportive, and dependable\n• Familiar with CI / CD pipelines and general software deployment methodologies\n• Has experience with coordinating incident response to quickly mitigate software deployment blockers and/or service health issues.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nRelease Management Support\n\n• Assist in coordinating release preparation and handoff activities across engineering teams.\n• Ensure required pre‑release inputs (e.g., configuration merges, build validation, dependency readiness) are complete before releases enter staging or production pipelines.\n• Support the queuing and tracking of releases in CI/CD pipelines, monitoring for progression, blocks, or delays.\n\nChange Request Preparation\n\n• Prepare change requests with accurate build data, affected components, justification, and required details.\n• Conduct first‑pass validations of change requests to ensure completness, and compliance with evolving partner rules.\n• Route change requests to appropriate approvers and monitor the approval chain, escalating when delays occur.\n• Support routine renewal/update cycles for deployment that are exempt from rigorous change management processes.\n\nDeployment Coordination\n\n• Coordinate across engineering teams to facilitate production deployments.\n• File and track support cases and bug reports as required to initiate or unblock deployments.\n• Monitor deployment progress, track success/partial‑success/failure signals, and capture notes for follow‑up.\n• Assist with retry workflows by incorporating updated build numbers and ensuring corresponding change requests are filed correctly.\n\nOperational Reporting & Communication\n\n• Prepare and share deployment updates in the appropriate communication channels and meetings.\n• Update dashboards and Confluence pages to reflect current deployment status, release progression, and changes in readiness criteria.\n• Summarize key updates for recurring release syncs and engineering review meetings.\n• Maintain accurate records of operational activity, approvals, and changes to support incident reviews and retrospectives.\n\nProcess Documentation & Continuous Improvement\n\n• Maintain internal documentation for change request submission, release handoff and deployment workflows.\n• Identify recurring gaps in release inputs, late configuration merges, or missed readiness tasks and help propose procedural improvements. Generate a backlog of improvements, prioritize improvements based on impact and drive for desired outcomes.\n• Assist in implementing process refinements recommended by senior engineering and production leaders.\n• Participate in retrospectives and governance forums, capturing action items and updating documentation accordingly.\n\nJob Requirements\n\nMinimum Qualifications\n\n• 3+ years of experience in software, operations, program coordination, or a technical support role.\n• This position requires US Citizenship or Permanent US Resident status. We cannot sponsor any work visas (H1B, etc.) for this role.\n• Strong attention to detail, organizational skills, and ability to manage multiple concurrent tasks.\n• Effective written and verbal communication across technical and non‑technical audiences.\n• Experience working with ticketing, workflow, or change management tools (e.g., ServiceNow, Azure DevOps, EV2, Jira).\n• Interest in cloud services, production operations, DevOps practices, and reliability engineering.\n\nPreferred Qualifications\n\n• Experience with Python and/or Powershell automation.\n• Familiarity with release pipelines, deployment workflows, or change governance (R2D/SafeFly experience a plus).\n• Exposure to Azure, cloud computing concepts, or distributed systems.\n• Ability to interpret technical documentation (e.g., deployment guides, configuration change specs).\n• Experience contributing to process or documentation improvement efforts.\n\nEducation\n\n• Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, Information Systems, or equivalent practical experience.\n• This position requires US Citizenship or Permanent US Resident status. We cannot sponsor any work visas (H1B, etc.) for this role.\n\nCompensation:\n\nThe target salary range for this position is $131,000-$164,000. The salary offered will be determined by the candidate's location, qualifications, experience, and education and may be outside of this range. The range is based on 'On Target Earnings’ (OTE) representing the total potential earnings, which is the sum of the base salary and potential commission earned when performance targets are achieved.
